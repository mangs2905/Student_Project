# Student_Project
This project is a simple student management system implemented in Python using the Tkinter library for the graphical user interface (GUI). It includes modules for managing attendance, assignments, notices, and payments, catering to the needs of teachers, students, and parents.

Here's an overview of each module:

Login System: Allows users to log in as a teacher, student, or parent. Upon successful login, users are redirected to their respective dashboards.

Dashboard: Provides a dashboard interface for users based on their roles (teacher, student, parent). It displays different options and functionalities tailored to each user type.

Assignment Manager: Allows teachers to manage assignments by adding new assignments, grading them, and viewing assignments submitted by students.

Notice Board Manager: Enables teachers to post notices, view notices, and upload timetables. It provides a simple interface for managing communication within the school.

Payment System: Provides functionalities for managing payments, such as adding payments, viewing payment records, and generating reports. This module helps track financial transactions related to student fees.

Attendance Manager: Allows teachers to manage attendance records, view attendance statistics, and check leave status for specific dates. It helps monitor student attendance and track absences.

Overall, this project aims to provide a comprehensive solution for managing various aspects of student administration, including academics, communication, finance, and attendance. It leverages Python's simplicity and versatility along with the Tkinter library to create an intuitive user interface for easy interaction with the system.
